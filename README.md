# Licenseplaterecognition
its a fun project just made to boost my knowledge for ocr so in this project we have used libraries like:
opencv : video images and everything processing is carried out by this.
easyocr: used this for the recognition of license plate and details
re : used for the matching of the details with the dictonary i have created that has various patterns of different countries 
matplot lib: i used this cause the imshow wasnt working in my system dont know why gui from the opencv isn't supported in my system..


what changes you guys can do?
you guys can change the patterns that i have used and implement more countries plate code so that you can recognize more country....
and do any changes you want 

resources used :
AI was used for debugging purpose like the imshow wasnt working so it suggested me to use the matplot lib....i was having sensitivity issue that was fixed by AI.
so overall i was having trouble making this so it took a little bit long for that to be made...
